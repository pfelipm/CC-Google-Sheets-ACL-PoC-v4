# CC-Google-Sheets-ACP-PoC-v4

Proof of concept of a community connector for Google Data Studio that offers a more advanced form of row-level security than the built-in filter by email in the data source. Some features:

*   Access control list is built into the underlying spreadsheet dataset and supports any comma-separated combination of email addresses, groups, full domains and a wildcard \[ \* \] that makes records public.
*   Uses a service account to access the underlying dataset with `AuthTypes.USER_PASS`.
*   [Stepped configuration](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector/stepped-configuration)

This is the final versi√≥n of the community connector proposed in Using community connectors to go beyond filter by email in Data Studio.
